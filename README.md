# Kia Ora! I'm Cheri 👋👩‍💻

I'm a full-stack developer who moved from New Zealand to Japan in 2016. For five years I was teaching English in Nagasaki, before changing careers and jumping into tech in 2021. I now work as a software engineer at SmartRyde in Tokyo. In the amazing five years I've been here, I've passed the JLPT N2, visited 39 of Japan's 47 prefectures, and built some cool projects I'm passionate about!
